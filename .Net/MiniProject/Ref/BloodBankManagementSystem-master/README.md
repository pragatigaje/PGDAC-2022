# BloodBankManagementSystem
Blood Bank Management System(BBMS)

I have made this application using ASP.NET Core MVC. For Admin panel, I have used SP-Admin. In this application bloodbank manager can manage the Donors,Events and Blood Collections.

The best thing in this application is, I have used Onion Architecture, which was the difficult part of this app.
