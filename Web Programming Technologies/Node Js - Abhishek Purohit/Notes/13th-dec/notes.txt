we can create a server
we can manage all the routes
we can pass some data on the url
we can also pass some data in the request body

> we are not having any UI (frontend)
> our server is only responding with either string or json
> for any web app, the frontend is also vv imp
> as of now we have to send the html files in the response 
> our frontend/html code should be able to display the dynamic data sent
  by server
  eg: server has sent an array of json objects 
  h1
  p
  
template engine:
when we have to respond with a template and that template should display
or render some dynamic data then we don't need to create html files
by ourselves and also we don't have to manipulate the dom in js manually

template engine will generate html 
we just have to give our dynamic data to the template engine
var f=120;
h1=f
if condidition
	h1
else
   p

PUG is a template engine

npm i pug

https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html

instead of the html files, we have to create pug files 
instead of writing html tag syntax we need to follow the pug syntax

create a folder views

.html file:
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Welcome to our app</h1>
	</body>
</html>



.pug file:

html
	head
		title My web page
	body
		h1 Welcome to our app

<a href=''></a>
<input type="" placeholder="" name="">

a(href='')
input(type='',placeholder='')


<form action="url" method="">
