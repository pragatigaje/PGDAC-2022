/**
 * Created by gouthamvidyapradhan on 22/10/2020 There is a row of m houses in a small city, each
 * house must be painted with one of the n colors (labeled from 1 to n), some houses that has been
 * painted last summer should not be painted again.
 *
 * <p>A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.
 * (For example: houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1] contains 5 neighborhoods [{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2},
 * {1,1}]).
 *
 * <p>Given an array houses, an m * n matrix cost and an integer target where:
 *
 * <p>houses[i]: is the color of the house i, 0 if the house is not painted yet. cost[i][j]: is the
 * cost of paint the house i with the color j+1. Return the minimum cost of painting all the
 * remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly target neighborhoods, if not possible
 * return -1.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target
 * = 3 Output: 9 Explanation: Paint houses of this way [1,2,2,1,1] This array contains target = 3
 * neighborhoods, [{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}]. Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9. Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: houses = [0,2,1,2,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target
 * = 3 Output: 11 Explanation: Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way
 * [2,2,1,2,2] This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}]. Cost of paint the
 * first and last house (10 + 1) = 11. Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[1,10],[10,1],[1,10]], m = 5, n = 2, target
 * = 5 Output: 5 Example 4:
 *
 * <p>Input: houses = [3,1,2,3], cost = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], m = 4, n = 3, target = 3
 * Output: -1 Explanation: Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods
 * [{3},{1},{2},{3}] different of target = 3.
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>m == houses.length == cost.length n == cost[i].length 1 <= m <= 100 1 <= n <= 20 1 <= target
 * <= m 0 <= houses[i] <= n 1 <= cost[i][j] <= 10^4
