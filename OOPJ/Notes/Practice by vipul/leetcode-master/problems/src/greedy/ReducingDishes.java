/**
 * Created by gouthamvidyapradhan on 16/06/2020 A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level
 * of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.
 *
 * <p>Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including
 * previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. time[i]*satisfaction[i]
 *
 * <p>Return the maximum sum of Like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes
 * preparation.
 *
 * <p>Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum
 * value.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9] Output: 14 Explanation: After Removing the second and
 * last dish, the maximum total Like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14). Each
 * dish is prepared in one unit of time. Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2] Output: 20 Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order,
 * (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20) Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5] Output: 0 Explanation: People don't like the dishes. No dish
 * is prepared. Example 4:
 *
 * <p>Input: satisfaction = [-2,5,-1,0,3,-3] Output: 35
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>n == satisfaction.length 1 <= n <= 500 -10^3 <= satisfaction[i] <= 10^3
