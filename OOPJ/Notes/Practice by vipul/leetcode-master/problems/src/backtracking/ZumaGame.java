/**
 * Created by gouthamvidyapradhan on 14/05/2019 Think about Zuma Game. You have a row of balls on
 * the table, colored red(R), yellow(Y), blue(B), green(G), and white(W). You also have several
 * balls in your hand.
 *
 * <p>Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand, and insert it into the row (including the
 * leftmost place and rightmost place). Then, if there is a group of 3 or more balls in the same
 * color touching, remove these balls. Keep doing this until no more balls can be removed.
 *
 * <p>Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the table. If you cannot
 * remove all the balls, output -1.
 *
 * <p>Examples:
 *
 * <p>Input: "WRRBBW", "RB" Output: -1 Explanation: WRRBBW -> WRR[R]BBW -> WBBW -> WBB[B]W -> WW
 *
 * <p>Input: "WWRRBBWW", "WRBRW" Output: 2 Explanation: WWRRBBWW -> WWRR[R]BBWW -> WWBBWW ->
 * WWBB[B]WW -> WWWW -> empty
 *
 * <p>Input:"G", "GGGGG" Output: 2 Explanation: G -> G[G] -> GG[G] -> empty
 *
 * <p>Input: "RBYYBBRRB", "YRBGB" Output: 3 Explanation: RBYYBBRRB -> RBYY[Y]BBRRB -> RBBBRRB ->
 * RRRB -> B -> B[B] -> BB[B] -> empty
 *
 * <p>Note: You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table wonâ€™t have any 3 or more
 * consecutive balls with the same color. The number of balls on the table won't exceed 20, and the
 * string represents these balls is called "board" in the input. The number of balls in your hand
 * won't exceed 5, and the string represents these balls is called "hand" in the input. Both input
 * strings will be non-empty and only contain characters 'R','Y','B','G','W'.
 *
 * <p>Solution: Maintain a count of each colored balls. Reduce the string to a new string by
 * removing the contiguous same coloured balls which exceeds the count of 3 starting from index i =
 * 0. Each new string formed (by adding a new ball to a position i) makes a new state. Backtrack and
 * traverse the search space and keep track of count of balls used. Maintain a minimum count
 * variable and return that as the answer.
